# Minimal Gruvbox UI theme for Stylish Firefox
Install from [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/130258/gruvbox-minimal) with Stylish.

Made for personal use and doesn't cover whole UI at the moment, though it may in the future. Currently only the main navigation and tab bar have been styled.
